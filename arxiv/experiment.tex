\section{Experiment}
We compare between our algorithm and traversal algorithm by
recording the maximum consumed gas fee.

  \label{fig:eval:root}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \input{fig/fig_tail.tex}
  \caption{Voting by delegate chain leaf.}
  \label{fig:eval:tail}
\end{figure}

We conduct the evaluation on Ganache, which is a
personal blockchain for Ethereum development that can be used to deploy contracts, and run tests.
Our implementation can be found here~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/freeof123/liquid-voting/tree/master/ether-eval/contracts}}.
As there is no standard implementation for the traversal algorithm, we
implement it by ourselves.  Specifically, the traversal only happens
when casting a vote, instead of delegating.

Our comparison is from two aspects, \begin{enumerate*}[1) ]%
  \item voting by delegate chain \emph{root}, as illustrated in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:eval:root}, and \item voting by delegate chain
\emph{leaf}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eval:tail}. \end{enumerate*}.
Notice that the gas limit is about 6,700,000 according to Ganache. Our
evaluation shows that \begin{itemize}
    \item the traversal algorithm performs better when the delegate chain
      is short, like smaller than 100;
    \item our algorithm significantly outperforms the traversal algorithm when
      the delegate chain is long enough;
    \item our algorithm can scale up with very limited gas increasing, while
      the traversal algorithm reaches the gas limit when the delegate chain
      grows up to 1,000.
\end{itemize}.
