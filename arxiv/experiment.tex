\section{Experiment}
We compare between our algorithm and traversal algorithm on Ethereum test nest, recording the maximum consumed gas fee, from the following aspect:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Random graph, random voting order.
	\item Chain, forward and backward voting order.
	\item Start graph (no delegation) any voting voter. 
\end{itemize}
representing two extreme cases and one normal case. The number of voter ranges from 100 to 1000000.
